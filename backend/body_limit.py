"""Reject oversized request bodies before they are buffered into memory.

FastAPI reads and JSON-parses the whole body before a route runs, so a size
check inside a route comes too late: one ~150 MB POST would OOM the 256 MB Fly
machine and take every route down. This middleware returns 413 as soon as the
declared Content-Length, or the bytes actually streamed, pass the limit.
